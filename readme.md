>The steps to get the ID and setting Image will be given below

<br />
The code below can be found in src/index.js 

```js
const RPC = require('discord-rpc');
const client = new RPC.Client({ transport: 'ipc' });

let activity = {
    details: "Your description Here.",
    assets: {
        large_image: "logo2",
        large_text: "Your logo's name Here.",
        small_image: "logo1",
        small_text: "Your logo's name Here.",
    },
    buttons: [
        {
            "label": "Button name Here.",
            "url": "Button URL Here."
        },
    ],
    timestamps: { start: Date.now() },
    instance: true,
};

client.on('ready', async () => {
    client.request("SET_ACTIVITY", { pid: process.pid, activity: activity });
    console.log("Client Ready.");
});
client.on('connected', async () => {
    console.log("RPC Connected.");
});

client.login({ clientId: "Your Application's ID Here." });
```
<br />

## Getting Application ID & Adding Assets
In order to get the Application ID, you need to login to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers). After logging in, create an Application by clicking on 'New Application' button given on top right, next to your logo.

After creating a new application, name it what you want.
> **Note:** The application's name will be in your status like: *Playing* ***Application Name***.

After naming make sure to copy the Application ID and paste it in the place of "Your Application's ID Here." in src/index.js.

After that, go to the 'Rich Presence' tab on the left navbar. [(Screenshot)](https://forum.cfx.re/uploads/default/original/3X/b/c/bca411d7b51bf613247873d39194255605e3e688.png)

Inside 'Rich Presence' tab, scroll down to 'RICH PRESENCE ASSETS' [(Screenshot)](https://forum.cfx.re/uploads/default/original/3X/c/a/cae8666cda59131cdb35a32e6802c4c31d9af5d6.png) and add any Image there (could be your logo). After adding, make sure to note down the Image's name u add (you can also change the image's name after uploading).

After uploading the logo, click on save and return back to src/index.js and replace "logo2" and "logo1" with the logo name you have added in the Portal.

# 
# Last step
The Setup is now completed, to  run the RPC, double click on the `start.bat` file inside the main folder. After clicking it, it will show `Done.` and automatically close the Command Prompt. 

You can also run it by copy-pasting the following command in Command Prompt,

```coffeescript
pm2 start ./src/index.js
```
> **Note**: Run the above command only inside the main folder. Not in the folder named 'src'.

### Hurray! The setup is done and the RPC must be running on your profile, if it dosent, create a new issue in this repository and we will guide you!
